      Taylor Swift is the self-titled debut studio album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. <br>
      It was released on October 24, 2006, through Big Machine Records. Swift had relocated from Pennsylvania to Tennessee in 2004, at fourteen years old, to pursue a career as a country singer-songwriter. <br>
      She signed with Sony/ATV Tree publishing house, and Big Machine Records in 2005, to work on her debut album during her first high school year. <br>
<br>
Of the eleven songs that made to the album, Swift has sole writing credits on three, and co-writing credits on the remaining with Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, Angelo Petraglia, and Liz Rose. <br>
The album was produced by Orrall and Nathan Chapman. The lyrics are about Swift's perspectives of life as a teenager, dealing with romantic relationships, friendships, and insecurity. <br>
Taylor Swift is primarily a country record with pop and pop rock elements, incorporating acoustic instruments such as guitars, banjos, and fiddles. <br>
Five singles supported Taylor Swift, including the Hot Country Songs number-ones "Our Song" and "Should've Said No", and Swift's first top-15 entry on the Billboard Hot 100, "Teardrops on My Guitar". <br>
Swift promoted the album by interacting with her audiences through MySpace, embarking on a six-month radio tour in 2006, and opening tours for other country artists throughout 2006 and 2007. <br>
<br>
Critics praised the album's mainstream sensibility and Swift's songwriting abilities at a young age. Taylor Swift was nominated for Album of the Year at the 2008 Academy of Country Music Awards and helped Swift earn accolades including a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist. <br>
The album topped the US Billboard Top Country Albums chart for twenty-four weeks, and was the longest-charting album on the Billboard 200 of the 2000s decade. Certified seven times Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), it made Swift the first solo female country artist to write or co-write every song on a platinum debut album. <br>
Journalists attributed Taylor Swift's success to Swift's online marketing atypical of country artists, who traditionally promoted their music via country radio. Her MySpace presence ushered in a younger demographic in country audiences who had mainly consisted of middle-aged listeners. <br>
<br>
The album's crossover appeal laid the groundwork to Swift's subsequent country pop discography.
